### Exercise Habits

![ABS Health Survey 2014-15 - relevant data](https://github.com/charlesluch/GovHack-Team1/blob/master/Datasets/Presentation/Vis%20ABS%2014-15%20census%20pie%20chart%20with%20brand%20colors.png)

Nearly half of Queenslanders are not getting enough exercise to maintain their health. During our commutes we habitually choose the most time efficient mode of transport over the benefits of a more active mode of transport.

The Artisan Hacksmiths applied themselves to finding creative solutions to this problem and came up with a web based application, [activecity.space](), that makes it easier for users to find healthier ways of getting around Brisbane.

Users input their origin, destination, and the distance they'd like to commute into the city using CityCycle, using .

The [activecity.space]() application design can also easily be scaled to include bike racks and water fountains using existing datasets.

In sum, we believe in empowering people to engage with healthier options when deciding how they commute and how they move around their city.

"In 2014-15, 55.5% of 18-64 year olds participated in sufficient physical activity in the last week (more than 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or more than 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both, including walking). Nearly one in three (29.7%) were insufficiently active (less than 150 minutes in the last week) while 14.8% were inactive (no exercise in the last week)."
