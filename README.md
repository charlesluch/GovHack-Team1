### Exercise Habits

![ABS Health Survey 2014-15 - relevant data](https://github.com/charlesluch/GovHack-Team1/blob/master/Datasets/Presentation/Vis%20ABS%2014-15%20census%20pie%20chart%20with%20brand%20colors.png)

One third of Queenslanders are not getting enough exercise to maintain their health. During our commutes we habitually choose the most time efficient mode of transport over the benefits of a more active mode of transport.

Addressing this issue will yeild great social benefit: community that habitually values and makes day-to-day decisions based on more important factors than time. 

The Artisan Hacksmiths applied themselves to finding creative solutions to this problem and came up with a tragectory of development for activecity.space that can foster greater and sustained user engagement, reduce congestion and air pollution.

We want to empower people to engage with healthier options when deciding how they commute and how they live around the city.

"In 2014-15, 55.5% of 18-64 year olds participated in sufficient physical activity in the last week (more than 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or more than 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both, including walking). Nearly one in three (29.7%) were insufficiently active (less than 150 minutes in the last week) while 14.8% were inactive (no exercise in the last week)."
