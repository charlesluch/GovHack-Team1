### The Idea

1. Health/exercise (clean transport, journey transport)
   * "I have to get to work, how can I do that with  benefit"
   * "How can I swap out my regular habits to have a healthier lifestyle through my transport habits"
   * 
1. Self improvement compared to demographics
   * 

### 1. Development
Charles, Anis, Michael, David, Ben
1. Get Datasets
    * CityCycle
    * Walking Paths
    * Riding Paths
    * Bike Rack
    * 
    
1. Incorperating the data into the project (programming)
    * A - B with a bike ride = C in 20km radius
    * possible add at the end: multiple users...
    * congestion line, outside this line, we suggest bike service/parking
    * inside the line, we suggest city cycle, bike racks, walking paths
    * 

#### Data Team:

1. Data cleaned and into relational table (Charles)
   * ORM (Object Relational Model)
1. Google maps API stiched in ()
   * HERE APIs, SDKs
   * jsfiddle.net    = plain code
   * material-ui.com = no need for style sheet
   * UI frameworks work with REACT
   * REACT state change reflects how it is...
   * 
1. Cheap/Free parking that we can stitch... ()
1. UI Home, Work, Exercise time @ type dropboxes...
1. 

#### Advanced features

1. Public transport integration
1. Redlands and Logan, then Aus wide

### 1. Pitch
Sophia, Adam, Joe
1. ABS Stat: [Exercise](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4364.0.55.001)
"In 2014-15, 55.5% of 18-64 year olds participated in sufficient physical activity in the last week (more than 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or more than 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both, including walking). Nearly one in three (29.7%) were insufficiently active (less than 150 minutes in the last week) while 14.8% were inactive (no exercise in the last week)."

### Datasets

1. Parking site datasets
1. 

### Note dump

#### CL
* QLD Traffic
* ABS taling points: Car/Motorcycle/Bus.Ave = 10.2/5.8/14.2/10.4 - (ABS survey of motor vehicle use Table 6)
* $23/tonne Carbon tax (back when there was one)
* More distance bt vehicles, less bottlenecks, less traffic shockwave

#### SL

### [Timeline](https://govhack.org/competition/competition-rules-code-of-conduct/)
- [x] 12pm Saturday Local time – all competitors must register as a user on Hackerspace.
- [ ] 5pm Saturday Local time – A __Team Project Page__ and your __prize category nomination__ must be completed in Hackerspace. Record all your team members on your project page and the URL to your proof of concept repository. No new projects pages can be created after this time. You are still able to edit your project page after this time.
- [ ] 4pm Sunday Local time – Your __video__ should be finalised and a URL linking to your video created to load on your Project page. It may take some time for your video to load once you have started the upload process.
- [ ] 5pm Sunday local time –  You MUST have all parts of your competition entry finalised before 5:00pm Local time which includes 1) your team page, 2) your ___data story description and detail of data sets used__ 3) your __Project outcomes (demo’s, code, graphics, photos submitted__, and 4) your __video__ link uploaded.

### [How to win a hackathon](http://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/advice/win-hackathon-seven-steps/?utm_source=GovHack+News+%26+Informationz&utm_campaign=543fc3665b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_06_13&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_227cbe7d1c-543fc3665b-131448985&mc_cid=543fc3665b&mc_eid=83461f0511)
1. Form a team with a variety of skills - great programmers, a video person, presenter, graphic designer...
2. Find an idea fromm open data sources [1](https://data.gov.au/), [2](http://queensland.theodi.org/home/resources/data/), ... based on what looks good and what you can do well in
3. Put yourself in the user's shoes
4. Clean and Wrangle Data
5. Be conservative with programming language risk - PHP/MySQL, lock down a specific set of oracle skills.
6. Get something basic up, then work iteratively to the dream.
7. Be succinct in the final submission
