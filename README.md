1. Form a team with a variety of skills - great programmers, a video person, presenter, graphic designer...
2. Find an idea fromm open data sources [1](https://data.gov.au/), [2](http://queensland.theodi.org/home/resources/data/), ... based on what looks good and what you can do well in
3. Put yourself in the user's shoes
4. Clean and Wrangle Data
5. Be conservative with programming language risk - PHP/MySQL, lock down a specific set of oracle skills.
6. Get something basic up, then work iteratively to the dream.
7. Be succinct in the final submission
